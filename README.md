# Baseball Fun  (bbfun, for short)

## About

Baseball Fun is an open-source baseball simulator.

ðŸš§ This simulator is under active development ðŸš§

## Goals currently working on (in order)

- Simulate a simplistic baseball game (`packages/utils/src/entities/game-sim/GameSim.ts` is where this lives)
- Save the simulated game results 
- Build a view to show the statistics/logs of a game
- Train data from the 2011 MLB season to build models for simulation (2011, because Cardinals!)
- Website to simulate 2011 MLB season and display league leaders, standings, etc.

## How to run

- Install packages with `bun install` at the root folder
- In VSCode, run tasks by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `Tasks: Run Task`
- Run task `dev-server` to start the dev server

## General Project goals

- Use the [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/) because it's awesome.
- Use Typescript/Javascript as much as possible
- Use R language for any data science/analysis not possible in the Javascript ecosystem
- Use a Bun workspace

## Personal goals

- Learn machine learning to build models for simulation
- Make fully typed (no Typescript `any`!)

## Libraries currently used

- [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting code
- [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/) to run Typescript code
- [csv-string](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/node-csv-string) to parse CSV files
- [dayjs](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/node-csv-string) to parse CSV files
- [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate fake data
- [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) to serialize data
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for utility functions
- [TensorFlowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for machine learning
- [zod](https://zod.dev/) for validating data


## Data used

- [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) for historical ID player mappings
- [Out of the Park Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/out-of-the-park-baseball-home/) for player ratings
- [PitchFx](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) for pitch data

## Current Bun limitations

- Haven't been able to find a Node.js machine learning library that works in Bun. I'm currently using TensorFlowJS, but it's not ideal. Training is slow and need to save/access the models via upload and download the models to/from the server.

## Feedback

The main reason I'm creating this simulator is to learn.  If you have any feedback, comments, or questions please reach out.  I'm open to any suggestions and ideas.
